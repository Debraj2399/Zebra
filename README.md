# Zebra
Zebra is a language dedicated to the simulation of digital electronics circuit and interfacing them with real breadboard circuits. Zebra will help us achieve the precise results of digital hardware using conventional coding. With unlimited digital resources, we can construct any circuit we desire without having to worry about finding actual hardware components. Moreover, we can connect them out to real breadboard circuits and run them together seamlessly. Thus, shortage of electronics components for breadboard circuits will never be an issue. Zebra breaks down the boundary between the real and virtual circuits. Whether we are trying to learn digital electronics or trying to bring our favourite circuit to life, Zebra will always have our back.
